### About

Codatta is a universal annotation and labeling platform that turns your intelligence into AI. Our mission is to lower the barrier for AI development teams by providing inclusive access to quality data, facilitating AI advancement, and to empower individuals to contribute to AI development and enjoy long-lasting rewards for their critical contributions. We tackle challenges across various verticals, including crypto (account and user annotation), healthcare, and robotics. Our user-contributed data is on the right track to commercialization in areas like web3 ads, AML, and healthcare.

### The Issues to Address&#x20;

We aim to address significant challenges posed by centralized data systems:

* **Data Silos:** Data is often locked within centralized entities, limiting accessibility and utility.
* **Lacking Data Integrity:** In-house and centralized models lack transparency in data curation and quality verification, and suffer from a single point of failure.
* **Inefficiency:** The traditional model of curating data is costly and involves a lot of duplicative efforts among projects relying on the same dataset.

In contrast, **codatta** aggregates and curates data from various sources, ensuring high quality and confidence through collaborative and automated mechanisms.

### Data Sourced

We build systems to scale up the curation and confidence of the following data:

* **Account Annotation:** This data pack contains categories (such as 'cex', 'scam') and entities (such as 'Uniswap') associated with an account. These data are critical for building AML software, on-chain risk management, and trend analysis. For privacy protection, codatta will not accept entity information revealing individual ownership of accounts or addresses. This ensures privacy while enabling confidence and quality measurement computation. If you are interested in the methodology of improving data confidence, refer to the following sections.
* **User Demographic Annotation:** This includes gender, age group, primary residence region, and other personal demographic details. These data enable personalized experiences in decentralized social and e-commerce applications. Additionally, this information can be monetized via decentralized ad delivery.
