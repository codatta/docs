# Quest

Quest is a collection of tasks on the Codatta platform, divided into two main categories: Emergency High-Reward Quests and Permanent Quests.&#x20;

Emergency High-Reward Quests primarily involve Airdrop activities with other web3 projects and short-term official campaigns. These irregular benefits are part of Codatta's operational plan to promote community development and enrich the platform's data interaction experience. The quests are diverse and challenging, allowing users to earn substantial rewards through various forms of competition. Codatta encourages every user to participate, leveraging their skills and efforts to realize data value. Emergency High-Reward Quests provide a valuable avenue for data tag experts to showcase their expertise and a stage for beginners to demonstrate their abilities.&#x20;

Permanent Quests serve as the primary learning pathway on the Codatta platform. They aim to enhance user understanding and provide a better user experience through additional reputation and points rewards. Users can complete a series of challenges with varying difficulty levels and requirements at their own pace, according to their preferences. Ultimately, users can become data tag experts and achieve data profitability.&#x20;

Each quest module serves as an aggregation entry for a series of quests, showcasing the characteristics of that quest series. For example, it includes Metis airdrop series quests, new system unlock practice series quests, user setting series quests, and more.&#x20;

The specific quest panel contains information about the quests, including an introduction and the types of quests available. Quests come with various rules, and different combinations of these rules create various quest types. The rules include the following forms:

* Time-limited: Users need to complete the quest within a specific time period. If the time expires, the quest disappears or becomes invalid.
* Trigger: The quest needs to be activated before it can start, usually part of a series of interlinked quests.

* Verify: After completing the quest, users need to click the verify button. The quest is considered complete only if the conditions are verified. This is common for inter-project linked quests.

Regular quests, whether triggered or not, can be claimed on the quest page as long as the completion conditions are met. Quests will have reminders.
