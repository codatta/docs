# Explorer

The explorer feature allows users to consume and provide feedback on data categories/entities. We envision users leveraging this function not to access and utilize data categories/entities and to report inaccuracies if they encounter them. This module encompasses two core fundamental capabilities:

1. Data Search and Categories/Entities Consumption: Presently, users can enjoy complimentary queries, but the system eventually transitions to a model where points are deducted for usage.
   * Each user is entitled to 10 free searches daily, cumulatively up to 100 free searches throughout their entire engagement with our platform.
2. Report Inaccuracies or Mistakes in Categories/Entities:
   * Users can indicate incorrect tags/entities by clicking the 'thumbs down' icon next to the respective data.- The 'Contribute' button is available for those aware of the correct categories/entities or wishing to suggest new ones.- Submitted contributions will be recorded in the 'Submission' module, and upon approval, users will earn corresponding rewards.

Note: Data marked with an orange exclamation point signifies that it is under review. Exercise caution when consuming such data.
