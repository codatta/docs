# Bounty Program

In the web3 ecosystem, collecting and tagging data for specific addresses (such as exchange cold and hot wallets, bridge addresses, ETF addresses, etc.) is crucial for the entire community. These tasks help enhance network transparency and improve transaction traceability and risk identification capabilities. By accurately labeling these key addresses, users and developers can better understand and track the flow of funds, thereby increasing the security and trustworthiness of the entire ecosystem. At the same time, this data lays the foundation for providing personalized services and improving protocol functions, contributing to a more efficient and secure decentralized financial environment.

\
This collaborative process of data collection and verification not only incentivizes individual participation but also drives collective progress for the entire community, contributing to constructing a more transparent and efficient web3 world.\
Our bounty program is designed to harness the power of our community to gather valuable data. Participants can earn rewards by submitting specific information we are seeking. There are two types of bounty programs:

1. Address Bounty: Submit information related to a specific address.
2. Entity Bounty: Submit information related to a specific entity, including associated addresses.

### Types of Bounty Programs

In the Address Bounty program, users' task is to provide information about a specific address. This could include identifying the entity that owns the address or any other relevant details we are seeking.

#### Entity Bounty

In the Entity Bounty program, users are asked to submit information about a specific entity. This includes providing related addresses or any other associated data.
