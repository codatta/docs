# Use Cases

**Web3 Advertisement Delivery:** dApps that honor user privacy and store no user data often monetize visits at low efficiency by displaying non-targeted ads. With demographic annotation data, monetization efficiency can improve by at least 10x, returning a large fraction of ad revenue to engaged users. **Example(s):** [Telegram](https://telegram.org/).

**Personalized Marketing:** Preferences can be derived from on-chain interactions with smart contracts and annotation data indicating their categories. Marketing efforts, such as airdrops, can be personalized for greater effectiveness. **Example(s)**: [DeBank](https://debank.com/).

**Compliance and Security Investigations:** Enables detailed investigations into fund flows associated with illicit activities, identifying malicious actors, and mitigating security risks. **Example(s)**: [Chainalysis](https://www.chainalysis.com/), [Sardine AI.](https://www.sardine.ai/)

**Trend Analysis:** Users can identify market trends, investor sentiment, and liquidity dynamics, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning. **Example(s):** [Nansen](https://www.nansen.ai/).
