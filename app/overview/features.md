AI mechanisms continuously analyze and verify data for accuracy, while community members contribute to data validation, enhancing integrity. Economic incentives like reputation scores and gas burning encourage accurate data submissions and penalize fraud, ensuring reliable and trustworthy data.

**Extensibility**: Designed for flexibility, Codatta can easily expand its data scope. The protocol's infrastructure, including validation, sourcing, incentivization, and governance, is adaptable to new data categories. This ensures Codatta evolves with the Web3 landscape, providing a scalable solution for diverse data needs without compromising performance or security.

**Public Accessibility**: Codatta is built to be permissionless, allowing developers, individuals, and protocols to access data freely. To prevent malicious use, minimal conditions restrict access to certain risky data sets. This approach promotes innovation and collaboration while ensuring data security.
