The <mark style="color:purple;">`Reputation System`</mark> within the Codatta Protocol evaluates a <mark style="color:purple;">`contributor`</mark>'s reputation score across four major dimensions: the total value of staked assets, data contribution (including the volume and quality corresponding to submission validation bounties), annotation skill level (indicated by results of quiz and tests), and the completeness of user identity information (such as, social proof, validated identification via KYC/KYB). These factors collectively determine the reputation of data contributors and influence their data contribution and verification behaviors within the protocol. The more positive each aspect is, the higher the reputation score.

\
Should a node engage in malicious behavior, such as intentionally providing low-quality data or issuing false data alerts, not only will it face the deduction of pledged tokens, but its reputation score will also be significantly reduced. This reduction affects its behavioral weight within the protocol. Users who severely violate the rules may have their reputation score reduced to zero, leading to the loss of any incentives from the community and rendering their contributed data invalid.
