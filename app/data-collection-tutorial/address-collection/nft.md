# NFT

## **NFT (Non-Fungible Token)**

How to collect: Monitoring NFT addresses usually requires access to NFT markets and platforms, which typically list the owners and related information of NFTs. In addition, you can also find the holders of specific NFTs through a blockchain browser.

* **Example 1:** Visit [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) or other NFT markets to find the address of a specific NFT, related transaction, and holder information.
