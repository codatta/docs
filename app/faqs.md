<summary>General Questions</summary>

* **What is Codatta**?
  * Codatta is a blockchain metadata annotation platform that enables users to tag and label blockchain addresses with relevant information, enhancing transparency and data integrity in the crypto ecosystem.

- #### How does Codatta work?
  * Users can submit metadata tags to annotate blockchain addresses through the Codatta Protocol. These tags provide contextual information about the entities behind the addresses, such as exchanges, wallets, or projects.

* #### What is the purpose of using Codatta?
  * Codatta aims to improve data transparency and accessibility in the blockchain space by allowing users to contribute and access metadata tags associated with blockchain addresses. This helps users make more informed decisions and enhances trust in blockchain transactions.

- #### Is Codatta's data reliable?
  * Codatta employs a decentralized approach to metadata annotation, relying on community contributions to verify and validate metadata tags. Based on AI and LLM capabilities, the quality of submitted data will be maximally ensured. Simultaneously, through algorithms and economic mechanisms, we strive to guarantee high-confidence address labeling results to ensure reliability for downstream consumer applications. While codatta strives to maintain data accuracy, users should conduct their own research and due diligence before relying solely on codatta's metadata.

* #### Is Codatta's platform secure?
  * Codatta prioritizes security and data privacy, implementing measures to safeguard user information and prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, Codatta employs blockchain technology to ensure data immutability and integrity.

<summary>Reputation Related Questions</summary>

* **What is reputation, and what's the use of it?**
  * The purpose of the Reputation System is to motivate nodes to provide high-quality data in a quantifiable way and to ensure the robustness of the entire protocol's data. A node's reputation score is directly proportional to its influence on data decision-making, incentive weighting, and community governance rights. This means that the higher the reputation of a node, the greater its influence on the protocol and the more incentives it receives.

- **How to improve my reputation level?**
  * The Reputation System within the Codatta Protocol evaluates a contributor's reputation score across four major dimensions:
    * **Total Value of Staked Assets**: The amount of assets you have staked in the protocol.
    * **Data Contribution**: The volume and quality of your data submissions, including submission validation bounties.
    * **Annotation Skill Level**: Indicated by results of quizzes and tests.
    * **Completeness of User Identity Information**: Such as social proof and validated identification via KYC/KYB.
  * These factors collectively determine the reputation of data contributors and influence their data contribution and verification behaviors within the protocol. The more positive each aspect is, the higher the reputation score.

* **Why did my reputation score decrease?**
  * If a node engages in malicious behavior, such as intentionally providing low-quality data or issuing false data alerts, it will face the deduction of pledged tokens and a significant reduction in its reputation score. This reduction affects its behavioral weight within the protocol. Users who severely violate the rules may have their reputation score reduced to zero, leading to the loss of any incentives from the community and rendering their contributed data invalid.

- **How many points can I get from a referral?**

<summary>Other Questions</summary>

* **What can I do if I encounter bugs?**
  * If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions while using Codatta, please submit a ticket to our Discord community through &#x2060;_#ðŸ“ªï½œticket-support_ channel. To help us locate and resolve the issue efficiently, please provide the following information in your ticket:

- **Is there going to be an "airdrop"?**
  * Community creates value. At Codatta, the community's role in sourcing annotation data is crucial, making this dependency more significant than for other protocols. Therefore, it is essential that the community receives a substantial portion of the token allocation. This allocation may be based on users' points, reputation, possession of platform NFTs, and overall engagement in the community. More details regarding this distribution will be announced soon.
