_Graph 1: Steps to Data Validation_\


Public voting is an important step in verifying the correctness of user data. It is also one of the important ways for you to obtain points. Please carefully review the data submitted by other users. As shown in Figure 1, you may elaborate on your reasoning when you reject or approve. A special note is that if your vote is consistent with our final judgment, you will receive corresponding incentives, but approvals do not guarantee incentives.

It is recommended to follow the following steps for an effective audit:

1\) Confirm whether the address and network submitted by the user are valid and whether there is a transaction associated with the address;

2\) Confirm whether the evidence submitted by the user is valid, such as whether the transaction hash is authentic, whether the text part clarifies the logic of the evidence, and whether the image is a actual and valid image;

3\) Confirm whether the evidence can prove the relevance and correctness of the metadata.
