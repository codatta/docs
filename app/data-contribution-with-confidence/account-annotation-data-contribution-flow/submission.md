Data submission is one of the important ways for you to obtain points. We hope that when you use Web3 services or browse information, you may contribute the metadata of known and valid blockchain addresses to our platform. The interface for data submission is shown in Figure 1. The first area is metadata information, including:

1. Network and Address are the unique identifiers of the blockchain address;
2. Entity refers to the owner of the address, such as the organization or company to which it belongs. etc.;
3. Category refers to the classification of the owner of the address. For example, when the Entity is Coinbase, the Category corresponds to CEX.&#x20;

The Entity is not required because, in some scenarios, we know the Category but not the Entity. For example, if an address is stolen and we don't know by whom, we can mark the Category as Theft. The second part of the area is evidence information, which is considered to be very crucial. Only if the evidence can fully prove the correctness of the metadata, will the submission be valid, and you can get the corresponding incentives as follows:

1. TxHash is the transaction hash that submits the address. In many scenarios, the metadata we mine is often obtained from a certain transaction. For example, when a user recharges money on an exchange, he or she can know that the counterparty belongs to the exchange based on the transaction hash;
2. Text is where the user elaborates on why these evidences can prove the correctness of the metadata and explains inference logic;
3. Image is the screenshot(s) of the evidence;
4. Link is the supporting information of evidence. It is not required, but it would be important for some scenarios, such as your evidence comes from a certain Twitter exposure, so you must provide the corresponding link. Again, your evidence must be able to fully prove the correctness of the submitted data.&#x20;

When the data you submit passes our AI automatic verification, you will see the interface shown in Graph 2 and receive the first part of the incentives. You will receive more incentives after subsequent verifications are passed. If the data you submitted fails to pass AI verification, please correct it as prompted. If you have any questions, please contact us.
