# Risk Disclaimer

To ensure fairness for all contributors, codatta transparently shares its risk detection mechanism, enabling everyone to understand our guidelines and engage with our project in alignment with its purpose.

1. **Zombie Accounts**: A single user creates multiple accounts (codatta employs machine learning algorithms and other technologies to detect if different accounts belong to the same person) but then ceases activity.
2. **Suspicious Registration**: Use temporary emails or addresses that either remain inactive on-chain or show a low success rate in subsequent activities.
3. **Bulk Movement:** Multiple accounts exhibit similar behaviors, such as identical login, submission, or validation times, coupled with a very low success rate.
4. **Repetitive Submission**: The same account, or different accounts identified as belonging to the same person, repeatedly submit identical or partially identical data.
5. **Bot or Automated Scripts Detection**: Multiple accounts are created using bots and engage in suspicious activities, including fake validations, forged data, and other manipulated information.
6. **Exploiting Loopholes**: Accounts may exploit loopholes or vulnerabilities in reward systems to earn rewards in ways not intended by the codatta rules. Once the loopholes are fixed, the reward earned during the loopholes period, will be re-evaluated.

Please review our rules and respect our values. If any suspicious activities are verified, you may not receive full points or rewards. We may also disable accounts if we determine that violations are persistent.
